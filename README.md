### 🌱 About Me  

I’m a motivated beginner in SQA, eager to learn and grow in software testing, with a keen eye for detail and curiosity about how systems work. I am enthusiastic about starting my journey in Software Quality Assurance. I enjoy exploring software works and finding ways to improve them. I am developing my skills in manual testing, API testing, and automation. Committed to continuous improvement, agile teamwork, and delivering high-quality, defect-free software products.

I’m using this portfolio to share my **learning journey**, **projects**, and **test artifacts**.  
I’m excited to grow as a QA professional — ensuring quality, one test at a time.
