### 🌱 About Me  
A few months ago, I began my journey into **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)**.  
I discovered that testing is more than just finding bugs — it’s about improving quality and ensuring great user experiences.  
I enjoy learning new tools like **Postman**, **Selenium**, and **Git**, and exploring how automation makes testing smarter and faster.  
My background outside IT helped me build strong **communication**, **teamwork**, and **problem-solving** skills — all essential in QA.  

I’m using this portfolio to share my **learning journey**, **projects**, and **test artifacts**.  
I’m excited to grow as a QA professional — ensuring quality, one test at a time.
